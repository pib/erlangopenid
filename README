An Erlang OpenID module.

Currently implements OpenID 1.1

To use, you call start_authentication with the claimed identifier and a URL to return to, then redirect to the returned URL. 

Upon return, pass a proplist of your GET parameters to finish_authentication, and you will get back {ok, Identifier} or {error, Error}.
